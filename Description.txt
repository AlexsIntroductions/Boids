for example: if the separation percent is set to 200, 1 / 200 = 0.05 or 5%. This means that the influence on the velocity will be 0.05% of the calculated value.

the higher the percent, the lesser the influence and vice verse until you reach 1, where 100% of the value contributes to a change in each boid's velocity
